This is an upload of my "3DSTS" project, created as a passion project to further my learning in sockets and non-Windows C development.

Code for both the 3DS and Windows apps are included.

Windows app is a Visual Studio 2022 repo and can be compiled to exe as is.
3DS app is created with libctru from the DevKitPro modding framework and should be compiled with DevKitPro (steps depend on your platform)

This app is provided as is and WIP updates will not be commited to this repository as internally I develop with SubVersion. Only major updates will come to this repo
if / when I make them.
